# Vinted Curation Bot - A Rebel in the Fashion World 🚀

## NOTE

After two enriching months at Epitech, I've gained invaluable insights and honed my coding skills. This initial version was conceived when I was just beginning my journey into the world of coding, and as expected, it had its fair share of beginner's chaos. Now, armed with knowledge and experience from Epitech, I'm revisiting the project to elevate it. This new version is a testament to my learning curve and my commitment to continuous improvement. I'm excited to bring a refined and enhanced experience to the community. Please check the v2.0 branch to find an updated readme. The advancement status can be found in the linked "la boutique d'Armel" github project.

## Overview

Welcome to the Vinted Curation Bot, where technology meets sustainable fashion, and where we say a big "No Thanks" to the fast-fashion industry. This bot is not just a piece of code; it's a statement, a stand against the ecological and ethical nightmares of the fashion industry. It’s a blend of tech and eco-consciousness, automating the curation of second-hand fashion items from Vinted, and serving them up to style-hungry, yet eco-aware folks.

## Why?

- **Sustainable Fashion:** We're tired of the fast-fashion industry and its impact on our planet. Second-hand shopping is not just a trend; it's a statement, a lifestyle, and a little revolution.
  
- **Tech for Good:** We utilize technology to promote sustainable habits, making second-hand shopping a breeze, and curating fashion that doesn’t cost the earth (literally).

## How it Works

### 1. Data Retrieval 🕵️‍♂️

- **API Requests:** The bot sends tailored requests to Vinted’s API, hunting down items based on predefined criteria like brand, color, and keywords.
  
- **Data Handling:** It processes the retrieved data, filtering items based on algorithms that consider historical retention rates per brand.

### 2. Manual Validation 🧐

- **Backend UI:** Utilizing Streamlit, a backend UI presents the pre-selected items for manual validation, ensuring only the coolest pieces make the cut.

### 3. Synchronization with Raindrop.io 🔄

- **API Integration:** Upon validation, the bot communicates with Raindrop.io’s API, updating the platform with the latest approved items.

### 4. Availability Check 🛒

- **Daily Checks:** The bot performs daily checks on Vinted to ensure each item is still available, maintaining a fresh and accurate catalog.

### 5. Stock Management 📦

- **Quota System:** It manages stock, ensuring a balanced and varied selection, adhering to predefined quotas for each size and category.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** For data retrieval, processing, and bot logic.
  
- **Streamlit:** For backend UI and manual validation.
  
- **Raindrop.io API:** For data synchronization and sharing curated items.

## Future Enhancements 🔮

- **Docker:** Ensuring smooth deployment and scalability.
  
- **Symfony:** For a robust and flexible backend.
  
- **Next.js & TailwindCSS:** Crafting a modern, responsive frontend.

## Code Notice ⚠️

Please note that the code for this project isn't super clean and is quite procedural. It was my first project ever, and while it might not be a paragon of best practices, it's a testament to my journey and learning curve in the world of development.

## Join the Rebellion 🚀

This bot is more than a project; it’s a rebellion against fast fashion, a stand for our planet, and a nod to the power of tech. It’s a journey from sustainability to style, all while keeping it digital and ethical. So, if you’re tired of the fashion industry’s antics and believe in the power of second-hand, join us. Let’s code, curate, and save the planet, one stylish outfit at a time.
